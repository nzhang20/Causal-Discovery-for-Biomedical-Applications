Microbial cells were then lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2 min (22C), followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol.

PCR reactions consisted of HotMaster PCR mix (Eppendorf), 200 M of each primer, 10-100 ng template, and reaction conditions were 2 min at 95C, followed by 30 cycles of 20s at 95C, 20s at 52C and 60s at 65C on an Eppendorf thermocycler. Three independent PCRs were performed for each sample, combined and purified with Ampure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt), and products visualized by gel electrophoresis. No-template extraction controls were analyzed for lack of visible PCR products. Products were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay as described above.  A master DNA pool was generated from the purified products in equimolar ratios to a final concentration of 21.5 ng mL-1 .The pooled products were sequenced using a Roche 454 FLX pyrosequencer at EnGenCore.

107.CM30	CACATCTAACAC	CM30	Columbia_Mice	EnGenCore	Faecal samples were collected from each mouse. Community DNA was extracted, prepared and used for 16S rRNA pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences).	Leptin levels correlate with the composition of gut microbial communities	TCAG	Frozen fecal samples from the cecum were ground under liquid N2, then a subsample of ~100mg was used for whole community DNA extraction._ A 100mg aliquot of each homogenized sample was suspended while frozen in a solution containing 500 ml of DNA extraction buffer [200mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200mM NaCl, 20mM EDTA], 210ml of 20% SDS, 500ml of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)], and 500ml of a slurry of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Microbial cells were then lysed by mechanical disruption with a bead beater (BioSpec Products) set on high for 2 min (22C), followed by extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and precipitation with isopropanol. The quantity and quality of purified DNA was assessed using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and a plate reader._6S rRNA genes were amplified from each sample using a composite forward primer and a reverse primer containing a unique 12-base barcode, which was used to tag PCR products from respective samples (Hamady et al.). We used the forward primer 5-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3: the italicized sequence is 454 Life Sciences primer B, and the bold sequence is the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F. The reverse primer used was 5-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3: the italicized sequence is 454 Life Sciences primer A, and the bold sequence is the broad- range bacterial primer 338R.  NNNNNNNNNNNN designates the unique twelve-base barcode used to tag each PCR product, with CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and rRNA primer. PCR reactions consisted of HotMaster PCR mix (Eppendorf), 200 M of each primer, 10-100 ng template, and reaction conditions were 2 min at 95C, followed by 30 cycles of 20s at 95C, 20s at 52C and 60s at 65C on an Eppendorf thermocycler. Three independent PCRs were performed for each sample, combined and purified with Ampure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt), and products visualized by gel electrophoresis.
