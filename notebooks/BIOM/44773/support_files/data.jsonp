EnGenCore."},"linker":{"107.CM19":"CA","107.CM23":"CA","107.CM10":"CA","107.CM14":"CA","107.CM25":"CA","107.CM15":"CA","107.CM13":"CA","107.CM32":"CA","107.CM22":"CA","107.CM06":"CA","107.CM07":"CA","107.CM04":"CA","107.CM02":"CA","107.CM31":"CA","107.CM11":"CA","107.CM01":"CA","107.CM03":"CA","107.CM30":"CA","107.CM20":"CA","107.CM27":"CA","107.CM26":"CA","107.CM18":"CA","107.CM28":"CA","107.CM24":"CA","107.CM17":"CA","107.CM09":"CA","107.CM21":"CA","107.CM29":"CA","107.CM08":"CA"},"pcr_primers":{"107.CM19":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM23":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM10":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM14":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM25":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM15":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM13":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM32":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM22":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM06":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM07":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM04":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM02":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM31":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM11":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM01":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM03":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM30":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM20":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM27":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM26":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM18":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM28":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM24":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM17":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM09":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM21":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM29":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT","107.CM08":"FWD:GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT"},"platform":{"107.CM19":"FLX","107.CM23":"FLX","107.CM10":"FLX","107.CM14":"FLX","107.CM25":"FLX","107.CM15":"FLX","107.CM13":"FLX","107.CM32":"FLX","107.CM22":"FLX","107.CM06":"FLX","107.CM07":"FLX","107.CM04":"FLX","107.CM02":"FLX","107.CM31":"FLX","107.CM11":"FLX","107.CM01":"FLX","107.CM03":"FLX","107.CM30":"FLX","107.CM20":"FLX","107.CM27":"FLX","107.CM26":"FLX","107.CM18":"FLX","107.CM28":"FLX","107.CM24":"FLX","107.CM17":"FLX","107.CM09":"FLX","107.CM21":"FLX","107.CM29":"FLX","107.CM08":"FLX"},"pool_member_name_renamed":{"107.CM19":"CM19","107.CM23":"CM23","107.CM10":"CM10","107.CM14":"CM14","107.CM25":"CM25","107.CM15":"CM15","107.CM13":"CM13","107.CM32":"CM32","107.CM22":"CM22","107.CM06":"CM06","107.CM07":"CM07","107.CM04":"CM04","107.CM02":"CM02","107.CM31":"CM31","107.CM11":"CM11","107.CM01":"CM01","107.CM03":"CM03","107.CM30":"CM30","107.CM20":"CM20","107.CM27":"CM27","107.CM26":"CM26","107.CM18":"CM18","107.CM28":"CM28","107.CM24":"CM24","107.CM17":"CM17","107.CM09":"CM09","107.CM21":"CM21","107.CM29":"CM29","107.CM08":"CM08"},"pool_proportion_renamed":{"107.CM19":"0.032","107.CM23":"0.032","107.CM10":"0.032","107.CM14":"0.032","107.CM25":"0.032","107.CM15":"0.032","107.CM13":"0.032","107.CM32":"0.032","107.CM22":"0.032","107.CM06":"0.032","107.CM07":"0.032","107.CM04":"0.032","107.CM02":"0.032","107.CM31":"0.032","107.CM11":"0.032","107.CM01":"0.032","107.CM03":"0.032","107.CM30":"0.032","107.CM20":"0.032","107.CM27":"0.032","107.CM26":"0.032","107.CM18":"0.032","107.CM28":"0.032","107.CM24":"0.032","107.CM17":"0.032","107.CM09":"0.032","107.CM21":"0.032","107.CM29":"0.032","107.CM08":"0.032"},"primer_read_group_tag":{"107.CM19":"V2","107.CM23":"V2","107.CM10":"V2","107.CM14":"V2","107.CM25":"V2","107.CM15":"V2","107.CM13":"V2","107.CM32":"V2","107.CM22":"V2","107.CM06":"V2","107.CM07":"V2","107.CM04":"V2","107.CM02":"V2","107.CM31":"V2","107.CM11":"V2","107.CM01":"V2","107.CM03":"V2","107.CM30":"V2","107.CM20":"V2","107.CM27":"V2","107.CM26":"V2","107.CM18":"V2","107.CM28":"V2","107.CM24":"V2","107.CM17":"V2","107.CM09":"V2","107.CM21":"
